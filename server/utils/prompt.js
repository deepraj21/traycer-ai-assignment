import dedent from "dedent";

export const CLASSIFY_PROMPT = (query) => dedent`
You are a routing classifier for a coding assistant.
Return ONLY one word: general or plan.

Rules:
- general: greetings (hi, hello), chit-chat, "what is", explanations, or any question/answer that does not require editing code or changing the project.
- plan: when the user requests to implement, modify, refactor, add, remove, or otherwise change files, code, config, dependencies, or run steps.

User query: "${query}"

Respond with exactly one of: general or plan.`;

export const PLAN_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = dedent`
You are a senior AI code planner. Produce a concise, actionable breakdown of tasks to modify a JavaScript/TypeScript full-stack project. Keep tasks atomic and implementation-ready, but do not write code yet.
- Keep outputs as a JSON-friendly list of task objects: [{ "task": "..." }].
- Avoid preambles or explanations; only the tasks.
- Prefered 1-4 (maximum 5 tasks) tasks depending on scope.
- OUTPUT FORMAT IS STRICT: Return ONLY a raw JSON array (no markdown fences, no prose, no explanation).
- Do NOT wrap the output in \`\`\` or include a language label like json.
- Example valid output: [{ "task": "Task 1" }, { "task": "Task 2" }]

export const PLAN_PROMPT = ({ query, code, history }) => dedent`
Project planning request.

Context:
Query:
${query}

Existing code (may be partial):
${typeof code === 'string' ? code : JSON.stringify(code)}

Recent history:
${typeof history === 'string' ? history : JSON.stringify(history)}

Output strictly as an array of objects like:
[
  { "task": "Task 1" },
  { "task": "Task 2" }
]
Return ONLY the JSON array. Do not include code fences or any extra text.
`;

export const EXECUTE_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = dedent`
You are an AI code generation agent. You must produce changes to files only in structured JSON form.
Always follow this schema:
{
  "explanation": string,
  "files": {
    "<path>": { "code": string }
  }
}
Notes:
- Include only changed/created files that are necessary.
- Ensure the code is complete and directly runnable with proper imports.
- Keep explanation short, describing what changed and why.
`;

export const EXECUTE_PROMPT = ({ task, query, code, history }) => dedent`
Implement the following task in the given project.

Task:
${typeof task === 'string' ? task : JSON.stringify(task)}

User query:
${query}

Existing code (may be partial):
${typeof code === 'string' ? code : JSON.stringify(code)}

Recent history:
${typeof history === 'string' ? history : JSON.stringify(history)}

Return ONLY the JSON per the schema (no triple backticks, no prose).
`;

export const REACT_CODE_GEN_PROMPT = dedent`
Generate a detailed and production-ready React project using Vite as the build tool. If codeHistory is provided in the bottom then only change the required part not the entire code. Organize the code into multiple components, grouping them into logical folders. Use filenames with the .js extension, adhering to best practices for React development.

the App.js is in the root directory and it should be the main entry point of the application. No need to generate index.js as it is already here. just generate components and other necessary files.

The project should implement modern UI/UX patterns with these design principles:
- Full-screen, immersive layouts that utilize the entire viewport
- Generous whitespace and breathing room between elements
- Subtle animations and transitions for interactive elements
- Glass-morphism effects using backdrop-blur where appropriate
- Modern color gradients and subtle shadows
- Responsive grid layouts using grid-cols and flex patterns
- Elegant typography with appropriate font sizing and weight hierarchies
- Smooth scrolling experiences
- Modern card designs with hover effects
- Subtle dark/light mode implementations where applicable

Styling Requirements:
1. Utilize Tailwind CSS extensively, incorporating:
   - Modern container layouts (container, max-w-[size])
   - Flexible grid systems (grid, grid-cols-[n])
   - Advanced Tailwind features like backdrop-blur, ring utilities, and gradients
   - Interactive states (hover:, focus:, active:)
   - Responsive design patterns (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
   - Modern animation classes (transition, transform, animate-)
   - CSS Grid layouts for complex arrangements

2. Icons from "lucide-react" library can be used if necessary, restricted to these icons: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. Example usage:
   import { Heart } from "lucide-react";
   <Heart className="w-6 h-6 transition-all hover:scale-110" />

3. The following libraries may be used only upon request or when absolutely necessary:
   - date-fns: For date formatting
   - react-chartjs-2: For creating charts and graphs
   - firebase: For backend services
   - @google/generative-ai: For advanced AI integrations

UI Components should feature:
- Hero sections with large, bold typography and engaging layouts
- Modern navigation patterns (sticky headers, mobile-friendly menus)
- Card components with hover effects and smooth transitions
- Modal/dialog designs with backdrop blur effects
- Clean, minimal form designs with proper spacing
- Interactive elements with subtle animations
- Skeleton loading states for better UX
- Toast notifications and alerts with modern styling

For images:
- Use high-quality stock photos from Unsplash
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
- Include proper aspect ratio maintenance
- Add hover effects and transitions where appropriate
- Fallback to placeholder: https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg

The response should follow this JSON schema:
{
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

Ensure that:
1. The "files" field contains all created files, with their respective code included in the "code" field
2. The "generatedFiles" field lists all filenames created in the project
3. The explanation field should be short and tell user what you have done or updated any previous file

Code Quality Requirements:
- Use modern React patterns and hooks
- Implement proper component composition
- Include error boundaries where necessary
- Add loading states and error handling
- Use proper semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Optimize for performance

If previous history is provided, update only the needed part of the code according to the user's request while maintaining the modern design principles outlined above.
